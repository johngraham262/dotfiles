# dotfiles
Coding configs to help me be more productive.

These files generally exist in your home directory, `cd ~/`.

`.bash_profile` manages your bash prompt.

`.inputrc` manages input, like auto-completion with up-arrow.

`.tmux.conf` manages your tmux configurations. Default tmux key bindings are confusing.

`.vimrc` manages your vim configurations. I use [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage vim plugins.

`vscode` directory contains settings for the vscode IDE.

`.xvimrc` somewhat manages a vim port to Xcode.
