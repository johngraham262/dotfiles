# dotfiles
Coding configs to help me with productivity.

These files generally exist in your home directory, `cd ~/`.

`.bash_profile` manages your bash prompt.

`.tmux_conf` manages your tmux configurations. Default tmux key bindings are confusing.

`.vimrc` manages your vim configurations. I use [vim pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to manage vim plugins.
